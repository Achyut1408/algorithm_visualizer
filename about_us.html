                Our Algorithm Visualizer is a passion project aimed at making complex algorithms accessible and understandable to everyone. We believe that visualization is key to comprehending these intricate processes, and our platform strives to simplify these concepts through interactive displays.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our team is comprised of enthusiasts from various backgrounds, including software engineering, mathematics, and education. We are united by our love for algorithms and our desire to share this knowledge in an engaging and informative way.
                <br>
                <br>
                The idea for the Algorithm Visualizer stemmed from our own experiences struggling to grasp these concepts during our academic and professional journeys. We recognized the need for a tool that could break down these algorithms step by step, allowing users to follow along and understand the logic behind each operation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our platform features a wide range of algorithms, from sorting and searching to graph traversal and dynamic programming. Users can interact with these algorithms, adjusting parameters and observing how each change affects the outcome. We also provide detailed explanations and visual guides to help users understand the underlying principles.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our mission is to empower learners of all levels to explore the world of algorithms with confidence and curiosity. We hope that our Algorithm Visualizer will inspire a new generation of problem solvers and algorithm enthusiasts.
